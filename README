# Plaspline, a pipeline for plasmid analysis form metagenome
# Introduction
*Plaspline* is a snakemake based workflow, which aims to get a comprehensive analysis of plasmid, both in gene and plasmid community level from short-gun sequences. The main steps are quality control, assembly, circular/linear plasmids isolation, circular/linear plasmids genome verification and classification, and plasmids-relative-genes analysis.
